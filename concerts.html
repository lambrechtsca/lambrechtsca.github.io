            Raffaella was a really fun and energizing opener. I had never heard
            her songs before, and I definitely left wanting to check her out
            more!

            Misterwives was, by far, the main reason I wanted to go to this
            concert, and they did not disappoint! They had the highest energy,
            most dance-able set I've probably ever been to.

            Simple Plan's set was a blast from the past the whole way through. I
            especially loved their performance of What's New Scooby Doo with a
            man in a Scooby Doo costume running around stage shooting tshirts
            into the crowd.

            Sum41 has been one of my favorite bands since childhood, and finally
            seeing them in concert was a very special experience. They had great
            energy and sounded even better in person than I could've ever
            imagined!

            With super fun and crazy visuals aided by funny bits in between
            songs, The Offspring put on a great show. I had a blast closing out
            such a great night dancing along to some of their most iconic songs.

            Carr appealed perfectly to the audience filled with mostly
            college-aged women, singing and joking around about relatable dating
            mishaps and connecting with the crowd. Super fun set!

            The last time I saw The Wrecks in concert was 5 years before this
            one, and how much they have improved since then absolutely blows my
            mind. The vocals, the instruments, the energy overall--all were just
            incredible. I can't wait to see them again!
