          <dt>Blindfold by Bombay Bicycle Club (feat. Liz Lawrence)</dt>
          <dd>
            I was not in love with this song at first listen, but then I
            suddenly couldn't stop coming back to it. Liz's unique voice defines
            this relaxing tune.
          </dd>
          <br />
          <dt>Fast Car by Tracy Chapman</dt>
          <dd>
            I have not been able to stop thinking about this song since
            Chapman's recent Grammy's performance--so powerful and emotional.

          <dt>Your Apartment by Wallows</dt>

          <dt>The Liftaway by Walk the Moon</dt>
          <dd>
            Walk the Moon's final release before taking an indefinite hiatus. A
            very bittersweet release for long-time fans, but overall, it is
            worth a listen.
          </dd>
          <br />
          <dt>Dripfield by Goose</dt>
          <dd>
            My favorite album to listen to while studying because it is
            simultaneously relaxing and exciting enough to keep me focused.
          </dd>
          <br />
          <dt>Immunity by Clairo</dt>
          <dd>
            With an overall mood similar to rainy days with a hint of sunshine,
            this is a great album for the springtime.

          <dt>Last Dinosaurs</dt>
          <dd>
            With their two new high-energy singles, N.P.D. and Keys to Your
            Civic, Last Dinosaurs is the perfect band to check out as the
            weather warms up for spring.
          </dd>
          <br />
          <dt>Bombay Bicycle Club</dt>
          <dd>
            With a discography chock full of amazing albums, their new EP
            Fantasies is a new, more relaxing take on their sound. I recommend
            just about everything they've ever made.
          </dd>
          <br />
          <dt>Misterwives</dt>
          <dd>
            An incredibly underrated band that has released countless
            high-energy, feel-good songs over the last decade.
