          <h3>Nobody Loves Like You by Atlas Genius</h3>
          <p>
            Atlas Genius is a band I really like, and it was exciting to see
            them release some new singles this year! This one was definitely my
            favorite due to the catchy chorus and overall good vibes, but it can
            be a bit repetitive at times and doesn't stand up super well against
            their past songs. I still like and plan to listen to it more,
            though!

          <h3>Stay by Post Malone</h3>
          <p>
            An incredibly relaxing song that is one of my favorites to listen to
            on rainy days. Whether you are studying, on a walk, driving, or just
            relaxing at home, this is one of those songs that always feels nice
            to listen to.

          <h3>Have U Seen Her by Kid Bloom</h3>
          <p>
            This song (and Kid Bloom in general) is perfect for anyone looking
            for something upbeat to listen to. With its fun sound and dramatic
            lyrics, this song feels like it has something for everyone that
            likes energetic indie pop.

          <h3>Soulja Boy Tellem by Soulja Boy</h3>
          <p>
            This is one of my favorite songs ever, but I have flawed taste. If
            you also like some songs just because they're silly, this is a great
            song for you!
