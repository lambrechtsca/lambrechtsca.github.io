        <p>
          I'm Megan, a college student with a passion for music. Whether I am
          singing, playing piano or bass, going to concerts, or just listening
          to and discovering as much new music as I possibly can--I am always
          connecting with music.
        </p>
        <p>
          This page was made to showcase some of my music opinions, experiences,
          and more with the hope of helping others find new music to enjoy.
